*Traditional U.S. electoral maps not only illustrate polarization, they can exacerbate it. No state is strictly red or blue, they are all shades of purple.*

In the United States, no state ever votes 100% Democratic (blue) or 100% Replublican (red), and yet this is how we are most accustomed to seeing our electoral maps illustrated. Such as this one from 2004:

![2004 electoral map with the West Coast, New England and Rust Belt states in blue, all other states in red](img/2004-traditional.jpg)

Authors of [a 2009 study](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2009.01183.x) proposed an alternate version of the standard electoral map using proportional shades of purple. States that voted more Democratic were bluer shades of purple, and states that voted more Republican were redder shades of purple, all depending on the percentages of the total vote. Here‚Äôs 2004 again:

Not only did this more accurately reflect the full, nuanced spectrum of the country‚Äôs political standings (as opposed to the winner-take-all system of the broken electoral college) but it was shown that it decreased study participants‚Äô perceptions of political polarization. The researchers demonstrated that the flipside was also true. Looking at those strict red and blue maps makes us believe that the country is more polarized than it actually is.

On [*Purple States of America*](https://purplestatesofamerica.org/), I've collected [state-by-state data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srbBVuDko3WbCrl9WTTkYJUX5OUKACsDY4t1S95inVk/edit?usp=sharing) from the last forty years of U.S. presidential elections and proportionally colored the map in shades of purple.

The site first launched with a **geographic** map of the U.S. and then I later added a proportional **electoral** map which is based on one used to illustrate the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact).

However, I've removed the electoral map (at least temporarily) in favor of one showing population.

I built this in the days following [the 2020 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election), before the final winner was announced. After four years of national trauma under the 45th president, it was baffling and sickening that the contest was as close as it was. Still, I was compelled to look for solace, answers, hope anywhere. The purple map helped me. Helped me to remember that just because a state is ‚Äúred‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fully that way. To remember that flipping another one may not be that far off after all. To remember that we need to fight the polarization that electoral maps, traditional and social media, and so many other things seems to push us toward these days.

Map data was pulled from Wikipedia pages and culled in a Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srbBVuDko3WbCrl9WTTkYJUX5OUKACsDY4t1S95inVk/edit?usp=sharing. I used only the totals of votes for the Democratic and Replublican party candidates. Third party candidates were not factored in.
